# Project-1
☐ <Simon Game>: The principle of the game is simple: the player has to memorize the series of illuminated rings and replicate it. The purpose of the game is to reproduce the series of colors/sounds randomly generated by Simon. Reach level 15 to win!

☐ Technologies Used: JavaScript, HTML, CSS

☐ Getting Started:  https://rebeccaloaustin.github.io/Simon-Game-Project/

☐ Next Steps: In the future, I would love to add a gameplay option for players to play with 4 colors or 5 colors. I would also like to add the ability for the lights to flash at faster intervals as the levels increase. Would also like to add audio to the landing page when user hovers over the play simon button.
