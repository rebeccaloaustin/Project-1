# Simon Game

The Simon Game is a memory-based game where players must replicate a series of illuminated rings. The goal is to reproduce the randomly generated series of colors and sounds created by Simon. Reach level 15 to emerge victorious! Inspired by the original Simon Game's emphasis on visual appeal, this version takes it a step further with a fun and neon twist. The glowing rings not only add a delightful aesthetic but also contribute to the immersive experience, making each level a colorful and memorable journey. Enjoy the neon-infused experience that adds a whole new level of excitement to the traditional gameplay.

## Next Steps 
In the future, I would love to add a gameplay option for players to play with 4 colors or 5 colors. I would also like to add audio to the landing page when user hovers over the play simon button.

Feel free to contribute or provide feedback to make the Simon Game even more engaging! And thank you for viewing my project!
